# XYZReader
Project 5 from Udacity nanodegree

## Fonts
1. We use Roboto for everything except Logo. We use `Title` style for Logo, `Headline` for an article title on detail
page, `Subhead` for a title on cards etc. In case of dark font we defined colors (`Black 87%` and `Black 54%`) but we 
use defaults.
2. For Logo we use ... that looks good with Roboto. We set font in a usual way - using `Typeface` in `java` code.
